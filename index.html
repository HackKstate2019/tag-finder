        <p>Tag Finder is an application that's used to find more news articles like the one you submit. This is possible due to a script that finds "keywords" based on the number of times it appears in an article. We only pay attention to nouns and proper nouns, and we cross reference it with a prepopulated database (made with other articles) and return articles with similar tags.</p>
