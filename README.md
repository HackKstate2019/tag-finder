Start of history -- We plan to use this file as a way to document the challenges we face on the way in the creation of "Tag Finder"<br>
Tag finder is an attempt at automation that searches an article for keywords and displays recommended and related articles in iframes next to the article

To run the server --> python tag-finder/tagfinder/manage.py runserver 157.245.10.177:8000

My role in this project was the logic and the html/css/js adaptations. Logic wise, we hit several roadblocks along the way. Because of all the libraries that were being imported for parsing strings and html tags, we were constantly learning and using new syntax and functions. Once we had everything "standardized," the project got a lot simpler. The hardest part was probably the database working with the server. Simply because we wanted to be included in the mongodb award consideration, we chose mongodb, even though there were better options for us. My specific hardest part was trying to keep up with python. I'm a strong logic guy, but I didn't know exactly how the programs were running. Once we were all on the same page, things got easier.
