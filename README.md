Start of history -- We plan to use this file as a way to document the challenges we face on the way in the creation of "Tag Finder"<br>
Tag finder is an attempt at automation that searches an article for keywords and displays recommended and related articles in iframes next to the article

To run the server --> python tag-finder/tagfinder/manage.py runserver 157.245.10.177:8000
